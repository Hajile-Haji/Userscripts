# MangaDex Userscripts

Some scripts I've made to help MangaDex Users.

## Reader Enhancments
This script makes the navbar sit statically at the top of the page. It also scrolls to the top of the page image in between chapters.

## Kissmanga Migration
This script is to help Kissmanga users migrate their bookmarks to MangaDex as follows.

## Search Page Enhancments
This script adds follow buttons for each series on the search page. This was built to work in tandum with the Kissmanga Migration script but works fine solo. More enhancments to come?

## Chapter Downloader
This script adds download buttons to each series on the series page.  Based on [Icelord's](https://github.com/xicelord/mangadex-scripts) and [Eva's](https://github.com/ewasion) download script.
